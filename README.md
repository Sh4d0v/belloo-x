<hr />
*Belloo is a Complete dating software with incredible out of the box ready-to-use functionality. Most of the functionality does not work properly or at all. The code is chaotic, written in a bad way, and contains all the bad programming practices you can imagine. In addition, it contains quite a few errors and is vulnerable. **YOU USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**.*

**Belloo-X is an attempt to modify the entire script in order to bring it to a usable state.**

> [!CAUTION]
> The original script contains many suspicious lines of code that refer or link to the servers/addresses of its creator.<br />
> At the same time, there are many references to the creator's domain in the database. Look for the string ‚Äúbelloo‚Äù in the database.

> [!WARNING]
> All products of the author Belloo: ‚Äúpremiumdatingscript‚Äù have been removed from Codecanyon probably for low-quality code, numerous bugs, user complaints and possibly theft attempts.

> [!NOTE]
> The official list of updates is here: [Belloo Updates Center](https://premiumdatingscript.com/updates-center)<br />
> Remember to never copy the **connect.php** file from the author!<br />
> Do not use his **php** and **sql** files, which are used for automatic updates!<br />
> Compare each file and its changes through [WinMerge](https://winmerge.org/) for example, and make changes manually!
